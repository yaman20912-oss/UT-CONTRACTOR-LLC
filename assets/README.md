# assets/
Brand images and static files for **UT Contractor**.

## Files
- `logo-mark.svg` — Square app icon / mark (uses #2082D3)
- `logo-wordmark.svg` — Horizontal logo with text (uses #2082D3)
- `favicon.svg` — Simple site icon (same mark optimized for small sizes)
- `brand-colors.json` — Reference of brand hex values
- `LICENSE.txt` — You own these assets. Update if you later use a different license.

## Notes
- Keep photos for the Gallery in `assets/gallery/` (add your real images later).
- You can replace these SVGs with your own; just keep the filenames the same and the site will continue to work.
